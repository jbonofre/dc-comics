= Dremio Cloud Comics

[abstract]
DC (Dremio Cloud) Comics is a cloud application platform.

== Rationale

With our objective to DevX (Developer eXcellence), we identified some points where we think a framework would help:

* Reduce the boilerplate to focus on business code
* Share a common backbone between our cloud components, increasing quality and productivity
* Improve gRPC communication with a strong typing via managed channel, introducing a gRPC client proxy
* Improve and efficient container image creation and seamless integration with Kubernetes
* Improve our testing layers, reducing the prequisites to test our components, and better leveraging mocks
