= Dremio Cloud Comic

[abstract]
DC (Dremio Cloud) Comic is a light cloud application framework.

== Rationale

Cloud applications require to be the most reactive as possible, and fast as possible to bootstrap. DC Comic chose to:
* Be build time oriented: only delegate to runtime the bean resolution (to enable dynamic module aggregation) and not the bean and model discovery nor proxy generation,
* Stay flexible: even if the model is generated at build time you can generally still customize it by removing a bean and adding your own one,
* Be native friendly: some applications need to be native to start very fast and bypass the classloading and a bunch of JVM init. For that purpose, DC Comic is GraalVM friendly.
* Provide turnkey services: DC Comic provides a wide range of services that cloud applications can directly use.
